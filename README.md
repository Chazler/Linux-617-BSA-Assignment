## Project
This project was made for the Linux 617 class at Otago Polytechnic Dunedin during my study abroad semester.

 **task1** 
  
  Task1 is a script that reads a csv file and creates users, groups and sharedfolders.
  It also assigns them the right permissions.
  
**task2**
    
 Task2 is a backup script.
 It creates a tarball from a directory and uploads it to a remote server.
